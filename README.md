# LD-3D-TFM
Large Deformation Traction Force Microscopy 

This repositry contains the Matlab m-files to run our LD 3D TFM algorithm. The first part of the package includes the FIDVC algorithm, which is how the 3D displacement fields are calculated. The second part of the code package includes converting those displacement fields into 3D surface tractions as described in [Toyjanova, Bar-Kochba et al., PloS One, 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090976).

Depending on the geometry of the problem at hand, the included surface normal finder algorithm might need additional modification for traction calculation in fully embedded systems or on arbitrary geometries. Alternatively, the user can supply the his/her own point-by-point surface normals to calculate the surface tractions (e.g., Matlab has several already existing image processing options for extracting surface normals from rendered surfaces).

## Running 3D-VTFM

### C Compiler
To run you need a compatible C compiler. Please see
(http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2015a/index.html)

### Input 3D Image Stack Requirements
* To check if the 3D image stack have the required speckle pattern and intensity values for correlation please use our [DVC simulator](https://github.com/FranckLab/DVC-Simulator).
* The 3D image stack need to be saved in a 3 dimensional matrix (intensity values are stored at x, y and z position) in **vol*.mat** files.  
* We recommend that the input image stack at each dimension should have at least 1.5 times of the subset size as the number of pixels. The default subset size is 128x128x64, so we recommend that the minimum input volume size should be 192x192x96.
* The size of the input image stack should be divisible by 0.5 times the size of the subset. 

### Running included example case
1. Make sure that the main files and the supplemental m files (from file exchange) are added to the path in Matlab.
2. Download and save the [example volume data](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByhZqlrbo5srdFhWampiT0g4Xzg&usp=sharing) in the example folder. 
3. Run the exampleRunFile.m file

### Health warning!
FIDVC in the 3D-VTFM requires a 3D stack to be read in, which depending on the volume size can require a **large amount of RAM** in Matlab.
